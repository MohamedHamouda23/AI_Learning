# 📚 About This Project

This project was originally developed as part of a university assignment at the University of the West of England (UWE) 🏫 and is now shared as part of my personal portfolio and resume.

🛠️ The code is based on a template provided by the university, but I was responsible for completing specific parts of the software and building the hardware required to demonstrate the project.

🛠️ It's here to showcase my work and to help others learn — you're welcome to explore the structure, coding style, and problem-solving approach for educational purposes.

🚫 Please don’t copy or submit it as your own — that would go against academic integrity policies and could be considered plagiarism.

👍 Feel free to use it for inspiration, learn from it, and use what you learn to build something even better!
