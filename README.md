# 📚 About This Project

This project was originally developed as part of a university assignment at the University of the West of England (UWE) 🏫 and is now shared as part of my personal portfolio and resume.  

🛠️ The work started from a template provided by the university, but I implemented key parts myself, experimenting with algorithms and AI concepts to demonstrate practical understanding.  

💡 This repository is intended to showcase my approach and provide a learning resource — you are welcome to explore the code, understand the experiments, and see how problem-solving was approached.  

🚫 Please do not copy or submit it as your own, as that would violate academic integrity policies.  

👍 Feel free to use it as inspiration, learn from it, and build upon these ideas in your own projects!

# 🧠 Machine Learning & AI Experiments

This repository contains exercises and experiments focused on **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Neural Networks**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** concepts. The content follows a phased approach, progressing from foundational ideas to practical experimentation.  

Early work explores **knowledge representation and reasoning** in intelligent systems. This includes rule-based approaches 🤖, finite state machines for simulating interactive behavior 💬, and graph-based structures 🌐 to model relationships and decision pathways. These experiments helped in understanding how AI systems can process information and make choices effectively.  

Another focus is on **search and optimization**. Various algorithms were implemented and tested, ranging from simple explorations to guided strategies that prioritize promising paths 🛤️. Efficiency, completeness, and trade-offs were considered, and iterative improvement techniques inspired by natural processes 🌱 were experimented with to see how solutions converge over time.  

Experiments also cover core **machine learning concepts**, examining different ways systems learn:

- 🧩 From examples to make predictions  
- 🔍 By identifying patterns without explicit guidance  
- 🎯 Through interaction and adaptation in simulated environments  

Early neural network experiments demonstrate how layered structures can model complex patterns 🕸️, and how learning propagates through the network.  

### 🔹 Tools & Libraries
- **NumPy**: numerical computations  
- **Pandas / Seaborn**: data management and visualization 📊  

Overall, this repository is a collection of hands-on AI and ML experiments, designed to explore concepts, test ideas, and gain practical experience. 🚀
