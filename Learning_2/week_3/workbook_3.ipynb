    "# Workbook 3: Informed Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will apply the Depth-first and Breadth-first algorithms you created last week to a new problem - navigating a maze (**If you have not done worksheet 2, go back and do that first**).\n",
    "    - A maze is a simple and easy-to-visualise optimisation problem to illustrate the properties of different search algorithms.\n",
    "    - A maze has a starting position and the desired endpoint (goal), so we need to find a sequence of inputs that takes us from the start to the goal in as few moves as possible.\n",
    "    - A maze can be modelled like a graph, just like fox-chicken-grain and the combination lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook will implement the Best-first and A-Star search algorithms.\n",
    "    - We will do this in a similar way as Depth-first and Breadth-first, by overriding the `select_and_move_from_openlist()` function of the `SingleMemberSearch` class.\n",
    "    - Depth-first and Breadth-first are both **uninformed** search algorithms, which means they do not consider the *quality* of a candidate solution.\n",
    "    - Best-first and A-Star are both **informed** search algorithms, which means they do consider the *quality* of a candidate solution.\n",
    "    - In the case of a maze, the quality could simply be the distance the candidate solution is to the goal (Best-first), or the number of moves so far + the distance the candidate solution is to the goal (A-Star).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third part of this workbook will test your understanding of these algorithms and compare their behaviour.\n",
    "    - And give you experience of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm for a problem (in this case path-planning) by creating different instances of a problem (mazes) to *stress-test* different methods."

    "As discussed in the lectures, we consider a general generate-and-test framework for search that can be easily adapted to provide algorithms with different behaviours and applied to many different problems.\n",

    "  - **SingleMemberSearch**\n",
    "  - **Problem**\n",
    "  - **CandidateSolution**\n",
    "2. Created your own search subclasses **DepthfirstSearch** and **BreadthFirstSearch** by over-riding the function **select_and_move_from_openlist()**\n",
    "3. Applied those algorithms to two subclasses of problem: **CombinationLock** and **FoxChickenGrain**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Week you can apply those algorithms to the problem of solving a maze.\n",
    "Run the following cells:\n",
    "1. The first ones import the maze and other libraries we need\n",
    "2. The second defines two functions for running a search algorithm on a maze and also testing different search algorithms. The function `test_on_maze()` compares the behaviour of your implementation with mine - they should match.\n",

    "    If <code>my_list</code> holds elements (objects) of a type that has an attribute <i>cost</i>, and we want to find the index (position) of the element one with the lowest value, we do it with a loop.<br>\n",
    "    Start in position 0, then loop through every thing in the list one by one, looking at the value of <i>cost</i> in each element, remembering the position (index) of the one with the lowest <i>cost</i>.</p>\n",
    "    In code this looks like:\n",
    "    <pre lang=\"python\" style=\"background:#ECFFDC\">    \n",
    "   best_index = 0\n",
    "   <span style=\"color:green\">for</span> i <span style=\"color:green\">in range</span>(<span style=\"color:green\">len</span>(my_list)):\n",
    "       <span style=\"color:green\">if</span> my_list[i].cost < my_list[best_index].cost : \n",
    "           best_index = i\n",
    "   </pre>\n",
    "    So at the end of this process the variable <code>best_index</code> tells us the index of the \"best\" element in that list according to our choice criteria (minimising cost). If we want to use something else as our criteria, we just change the if statement.<br><br>\n",
    "    Sometimes you might choose to store the value <code> best_so_far = my_list[best_index].cost</code> and use that in the comparison (line 3 above) to make your code more readable (shorter lines).<br>\n",
    "    You just need to update <code>best_so_far</code> as well as <code>best_index</code> inside the <code>if</code> statement.<br><br>\n",
    "    So this different version of the code does the same thing but you may find it easier to understand.\n",
    "    <pre lang=\"python\" style=\"background:#ECFFDC\">\n",
    "    best_index = 0\n",
